#+title: Guix WSL Image

Guix provides the facilities to build system images for WSL2, and
provids a sample system object called =wsl-os=, but unfortunately, there
are no pre-built images.

This repo provides that sample images in the release. If you have a
Linux machine that already has Guix, you're better off building
yourself:
#+begin_src shell
guix system image -t wsl2 -e '(@ (gnu system images wsl2) wsl-os)'
#+end_src
